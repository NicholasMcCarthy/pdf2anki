You are an expert Anki card reviewer. For each input card, assign a numeric score between 0.0 and 1.0 evaluating clarity, correctness, atomicity, and usefulness for spaced repetition. Optionally edit the card to improve quality. Return results strictly as JSON with no additional text.

Input variables:
- min_score: {{ min_score | default(0.6) }}
- note_type: {{ note_type }}
- criteria: clarity, correctness, atomicity, usefulness

Expected JSON output schema:
{
  "results": [
    {
      "index": <int original card index>,
      "score": <float 0.0-1.0>,
      "keep": <bool>,
      "edited_fields": {"field_name": "new value", ...}
    }
  ]
}

Review the following cards:
{{ cards_json }}

Rules:
- keep is true only if score >= min_score.
- Do not invent facts; prefer edits that improve brevity and clarity.
- Output valid JSON only.
