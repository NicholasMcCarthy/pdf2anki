You are analyzing the following text from "{{ pdf_title }}" (pages {{ page_start }}-{{ page_end }}):

{% if section %}
**Section**: {{ section }}
{% endif %}

**Text Content**:
{{ chunk }}

**Task**: Generate {{ max_cards | default(5) }} cloze deletion flashcards focusing on key terms, definitions, formulas, and important concepts from this text.

**Requirements**:
1. Identify important terms, concepts, numbers, and relationships
2. Create meaningful cloze deletions using {{c1::text}} format
3. Provide sufficient context to make the cloze meaningful
4. Avoid creating too many cloze deletions in one card (max 3 per card)
5. Include page citations for reference
6. Focus on testable, important knowledge

**Cloze Guidelines**:
- Good: "The {{c1::mitochondria}} is known as the {{c2::powerhouse of the cell}} because it produces {{c3::ATP}}."
- Avoid: "{{c1::The}} {{c2::mitochondria}} {{c3::is}} {{c4::known}} {{c5::as}}..." (too many deletions)

**Output Format**: Respond with valid JSON containing an array of cloze flashcard objects:

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "cloze_text": "Text with {{c1::cloze}} deletions",
      "extra": "Additional context or explanation",
      "page_citation": "p. {{ page_start }}",
      "core_concept": "Main concept being tested",
      "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
      "tags": ["definition", "term"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Focus Areas**:
- Key terms and their definitions
- Important formulas or equations
- Specific numbers, dates, or measurements
- Cause-and-effect relationships
- Process steps or sequences
- Classifications and categories
